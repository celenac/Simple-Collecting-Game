		<p>A template for a collecting game. You are the white square and there are 10 red squares on the screen for you to collect. There are still many bugs and defaults, but I am still in the process of fixing them.</p>
		<p>Use arrow keys to move around and jump.</p>
		<p>The platforms are randomly generated and they sometimes are generated in places impossible for you to reach, so refresh the page and test it out.<p>
