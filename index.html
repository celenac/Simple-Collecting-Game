		<p>A template for a collecting game. You are the white square and there are 10 red squares on the screen for you to collect. There are still many bugs and defaults, but I am still in the process of fixing them. Use <b>arrow keys</b> to move around and jump.</p>
		<p>Note: Platforms are randomly generated, so they sometimes are in places impossible for you to reach. As of now, refresh the page until the platforms are in reachable spots. This is a default and I am working on improving it.<p>
